# 📝 Group 2 OULAD Data Engineering Project - Final Documentation & Presentation Guide

This guide documents our group's **dimensional modeling exercise** on the OULAD (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset).  
Follow this structure for both internal documentation and final presentation.

---

## 1. Project Overview

- **Dataset Used:**  
  OULAD (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) - A comprehensive educational dataset containing student demographics, course information, assessment results, and Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) interactions from the Open University. The dataset includes 7 CSV files covering student journeys from enrollment to completion.

- **Goal of the Exercise:**  
  Transform raw educational CSV files into a production-ready dimensional model to answer the critical business question: **"Do demographics influence student dropout rates?"** The objective was to build a complete modern data pipeline from ingestion to analytics using industry-standard tools.

- **Team Setup:**  
  Group 2 collaborative project with individual contributions to different pipeline components. Team worked together on design decisions while splitting implementation tasks across ingestion, transformation, and analytics layers.

- **Environment Setup:**  
  Shared Docker containerized environment on Ubuntu WSL with:
  - ClickHouse database (shared remote instance)
  - DLT (Data Loading Tool) for ingestion
  - dbt (Data Build Tool) for transformations
  - Individual local development with shared database access
  - Version control via Git for collaborative development

## 3. Modeling Process

- **Source Structure (Normalized):**  
  The OULAD dataset comes in 3rd Normal Form with separate entities:
  - `studentInfo.csv` - Student demographics (32,593 records)
  - `courses.csv` - Course module information (22 courses)
  - `assessments.csv` - Assessment definitions (206 assessments)
  - `studentAssessment.csv` - Student-assessment results (173,912 records)
  - `studentRegistration.csv` - Enrollment data (32,593 records)
  - `studentVle.csv` - VLE interaction logs (10.6M records)
  - `vle.csv` - VLE content metadata (6,364 activities)

- **Star Schema Design:**  
  **Fact Tables:**
  - `mart.grp2_fact_student_assessments` - Assessment events with scores, dates, performance metrics
  - `mart.grp2_fact_vle_interactions` - VLE click-stream data with engagement patterns
  
  **Dimension Tables:**
  - `mart.grp2_dim_student` - Student demographics with risk profiling
  - `mart.grp2_dim_course` - Course details with duration and presentation metadata  
  - `mart.grp2_dim_assessment` - Assessment types, weights, and scheduling information
  
  **Analytics Views:**
  - `mart.grp2_demographics_dropout_analysis` - Core business question analysis

- **Challenges / Tradeoffs:**  
  - **Data Quality:** Raw data contained `?` values requiring systematic null handling
  - **Schema Evolution:** Column name mismatches between CSV and expected dbt model references
  - **Volume Processing:** 10M+ VLE records required performance optimization
  - **Business Logic:** Translating educational domain knowledge into analytical dimensions
  - **Collaboration:** Managing shared database access and model dependencies across team members

## 5. Business Questions & Insights

- **Primary Business Question:**  
  **"Do demographics influence student dropout rates?"**
  
  **Supporting Questions:**
  1. Which demographic combinations show highest dropout risk?
  2. How do education levels correlate with student success?
  3. Are there regional patterns in student performance?
  4. What is the impact of disability status on completion rates?

- **Dashboards / Queries:**  
  **Created 7 Metabase-ready visualization queries:**
  1. **Dropout Rate by Demographics** (Bar Chart) - Shows risk groups by gender/age combinations
  2. **Education Level Impact** (Column Chart) - Compares success across qualification levels
  3. **Age Band Analysis** (Line Chart) - Reveals age and gender interaction patterns
  4. **Disability Impact** (Pie Chart) - Quantifies accessibility challenges
  5. **Regional Risk Heatmap** (Table) - Geographic success pattern analysis
  6. **Executive Summary** (Number Cards) - Key performance indicators
  7. **Action Priority Matrix** (Scatter Plot) - Intervention prioritization framework

- **Key Insights from Analysis:**  
  - **Demographic Risk Stratification:** Identified specific combinations of gender, age, and education level with significantly higher dropout rates (>40% vs ~28% average)
  - **Education Level Correlation:** Clear pattern showing higher qualifications correlate with better completion rates
  - **Accessibility Impact:** Quantified the effect of disability status on student success outcomes
  - **Regional Variations:** Discovered geographic patterns that suggest socioeconomic factors influence educational success
